\title{Filter and Save Raster Patches Exceeding a Minimum Area}
\usage{
filter_min_area_by_patch(
  patch_loc,
  full_rast_loc,
  patch_num,
  min_area,
  save_loc,
  save_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{patch_loc}{Character. File path to the raster containing patch IDs.}

\item{full_rast_loc}{Character. File path to the main raster data from which patches will be masked and extracted.}

\item{patch_num}{Character. Underscore-separated string of patch ID numbers to process (e.g., \code{"1_5_7"}; no default).}

\item{min_area}{Numeric. Minimum area (in square meters) required for a patch to be saved.}

\item{save_loc}{Character. Directory path to save raster outputs.}

\item{save_name}{Character. Base name to use for saved raster files.}
}
\value{
Saves raster patches that exceed the area threshold as GeoTIFFs in the specified location. Does not return an R object.
}
\description{
This function filters raster patches by a minimum area threshold and saves those exceeding the threshold to disk.
}
\details{
For each patch number listed in \code{patch_num}, this function masks the \code{full_rast} raster using the \code{full_patch} raster as a mask. It then trims the resulting raster to remove NA padding and calculates the patch area. If the area exceeds \code{min_area}, the patch is saved as a GeoTIFF to \code{save_loc}, with filenames including \code{save_name} and the patch number.
