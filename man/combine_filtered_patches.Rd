\title{Combine Filtered Patch Rasters into a Mosaic}
\usage{
combine_filtered_patches(
  patch_location,
  save_loc,
  mosaic_fun = "max",
  save_name = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{patch_location}{Character. Path to the directory containing raster files to be combined.}

\item{save_loc}{Character. Directory where the combined mosaic raster will be saved.}

\item{mosaic_fun}{Character. The function used to combine overlapping raster cells. Common options include \code{"mean"}, \code{"max"}, or \code{"sum"}. Default is \code{"max"}.}

\item{save_name}{Character. Name (without extension) for the output mosaic raster file. Default is an empty string.}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object to the R environment. It writes a raster mosaic to the specified \code{save_loc} with a \code{.tif} extension.
}
\description{
Combines multiple raster files representing filtered patches into a single raster mosaic using a specified function. The resulting mosaic is written to disk.
}
\details{
The function reads all raster files from the provided \code{patch_location}, creates a \code{SpatRasterCollection}, mosaics them using the specified combining function, and saves the result to disk.

\dontrun{
combine_filtered_patches("outputs/filtered_patches/", 
                         save_name = "combined_filtered_patches")
