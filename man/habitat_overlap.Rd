}
\arguments{
\item{spatial_object}{\code{sf} object containing the habitat polygons to analyze.}

\item{habitat_column_name}{\code{character} Column name in the \code{spatial_object} that identifies habitat types or groups. Used to identify if joined polygons were the same or different habitats.}

\item{extent}{\code{numeric} Vector of four values (\code{xmin}, \code{ymin}, \code{xmax}, \code{ymax}) defining the region of interest. Defaults to \code{NULL} (no cropping).}

\item{buffer_distance}{\code{numeric} Distance (in meters) for buffering the polygons.}

\item{connection_distance}{\code{numeric} Distance (in meters) used to determine connectivity between polygons.}

\item{min_area}{\code{numeric} Minimum area (in square meters) required to retain polygons. Smaller polygons are filtered out. No default, must be specified.}

\item{combine_touching_polys}{\code{logical} Whether to combine polygons that touch. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{min_core_area}{\code{numeric} Minimum area of "core" (i.e. contiguous) habitat. If not \code{NULL}, filters out polygons smaller than this value before combining polygons within \code{connect_dist} of each other. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{combine_close_polys}{\code{logical} Whether to combine polygons within \code{connection_distance}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plot_it}{\code{logical} Whether to generate and display diagnostic plots at each step. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{resolution}{\code{numeric} Resolution of the output raster, specified as a vector of two values. Defaults to \code{c(10, 10)}.}

\item{quiet}{\code{logical} Whether to print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{combined_object}: \code{sf} object of the combined polygons.
\item \code{buffered_object}: \code{sf} object of the buffered polygons with overlap counts.
\item \code{buffered_raster_stack}: Raster stack showing buffered polygons.
\item \code{buffered_raster_overlaps}: Raster showing the sum of overlaps across buffered polygons.
\item \code{habitat_connectivity_raster}: Raster identifying regions of potential habitat connectivity.

Identify Habitat Overlaps and Connectivity
}
\details{
Processes spatial habitat data to identify overlaps, connectivity, and areas for potential habitat linkage.
Supports combining polygons, buffering, and converting spatial data into raster format.
