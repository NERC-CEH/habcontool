\title{Identify Patches in a Raster}
\usage{
identify_patches(
  file_to_read,
  save_loc,
  directions = 8,
  allowGaps = FALSE,
  values = FALSE,
  zeroAsNA = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_to_read}{Character. Path to the input raster file.}

\item{save_loc}{Character. Directory where the resulting raster will be saved. The file will be named with the prefix \code{"patch_ids_"}.}

\item{directions}{Integer. Neighborhood connectivity to use for patch identification. Accepts 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case). Default is 8.}

\item{allowGaps}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, allows gaps (NA cells) within patches. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{values}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns a raster with original values instead of patch IDs. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{zeroAsNA}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, treats 0s as NA when identifying patches. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object to the R environment. It writes a new raster file containing patch IDs to the specified \code{save_loc}.
}
\description{
Reads a raster file and identifies spatial patches based on user-defined neighborhood connectivity and gap handling. The resulting raster with patch IDs is written to disk.
}
\details{
Patches are contiguous regions of similar values in the raster. The \code{terra::patches()} function is used to identify them with control over neighborhood connectivity, inclusion of gaps, and treatment of zero values.

\dontrun{
identify_patches("data/habitat.tif", "output/", directions = 4, allowGaps = TRUE)
