Combine Polygons That Touch or Are Close}
\usage{
combine_touching(
  comb_obj,
  variable_name = NULL,
  min_core_area = NULL,
  combine_close = TRUE,
  connect_dist = 100,
  Plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comb_obj}{\code{sf} object containing the polygons to combine.}

\item{variable_name}{\code{character} Name of the column used for grouping polygons. If \code{NULL}, polygons are combined without keeping the habitat type. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{min_core_area}{\code{numeric} Minimum area of "core" (i.e. contiguous) habitat. If not \code{NULL}, filters out polygons smaller than this value before combining polygons within \code{connect_dist} of each other. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{combine_close}{\code{logical} Whether to combine polygons that are within \code{connect_dist} of each other. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{connect_dist}{\code{numeric} Distance threshold for combining polygons (in spatial units). Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{Plot}{\code{logical} Whether to plot the combined polygons. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object with combined polygons and updated grouping information.
}
\description{
Combines polygons in a spatial object that either touch or are within a specified distance of each other.

\examples{
\dontrun{
combined <- combine_touching(spatial_data, "habitat_type", TRUE, 200, TRUE)
}
