\title{Create Grids with Buffer Zones}
\usage{
create_grids(
  spatial_object,
  grid_size = 10000,
  clip_to_poly = TRUE,
  return_format = "sf"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatial_object}{An \code{sf} object representing the spatial region over which the grid will be created.}

\item{grid_size}{Numeric. The size of each grid cell in map units (default is \code{10000}).}

\item{clip_to_poly}{Binary. Whether to return only grids overlapping the polygon.}

\item{return_format}{The class of object to return. One of c("sf", "extent", "wkt")}

\item{grid_buffer_size}{Numeric. The buffer distance applied to each grid cell in map units
(default is equal to \code{grid_size}).}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{central_grid}{A list of bounding boxes representing the central grid cells.}
\item{buffered_grid}{A list of bounding boxes representing the buffered grid cells.}
}

}
\details{
WARNING: Ensure the \code{spatial_object} is appropriately projected and aligned with the desired
coordinate system for accurate grid creation and buffering.

This function creates a grid of specified size over a given spatial object and generates a buffered
version of the grid. It also extracts the bounding box values for both the central grid and the
buffered grid to define regions of interest.
